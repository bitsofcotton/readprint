# readprint
Read and print first sector as early stage as user possible but with firmware.

# Description
Read and print storage first sector on possible early user's boot process with first firmware the hardware have.
Works with system separated working external camera, only shows theirself and first some sectors.

However, this is only to ease ourself not to be inserted some of the code.
So if the firmware is infected, we cannot check them at all.

To use this with effective, it is recommended to write entity to after second sector, and check them by cross-platform and write first sector as only read/jump second sector. However, ever in this case, the data can be cheated by firmware if they're completely infected.
